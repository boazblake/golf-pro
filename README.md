Golf Swing pro

Using Deno to scrape free videos of random pro golf swings from random angles.
I fed that into the Google pose AI to extract the body coordinates for each golfer, (normalized to their body length proportions).
The purpose is to train the AI with the golf swings to then track with the lift mate app to inform the user about their real time golf swing.
